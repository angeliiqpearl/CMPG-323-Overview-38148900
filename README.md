### Storage of credentials and sensitive information
Sensitive information that may no longer be of use will be deleted, reason being that they have the potential to cause problems in future. One common practice would be to encrypt file containing sensitive information and have backups. The backups could be stored in a different drive or secure cloud storage. 

The .gitignore file may be used in the above mentioned projects, to ignore files that do not have to committed and not track them. These files could have a .txt extension, which may contain certain instructions about the project and execution, or passwords for instance.
